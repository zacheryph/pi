/**
 * package-exclusions.ts — build a child-local view of Pi's package settings
 * that disables selected packages' extensions (issue #696).
 *
 * Pi resolves a child session's resources from `Settings.packages`. An entry in
 * object form with `extensions: []` loads none of that package's extensions in
 * both of Pi's filter modes — the default mode treats the empty array as an
 * explicit disable, and `autoload: false` delta mode starts empty and only adds
 * explicitly listed patterns. Filtering here, at resolution time, means the
 * excluded package's extension module is never imported and its factory never
 * runs, which is what makes this a prevent-load seam rather than a deny-at-use
 * one. The package's skills, prompts, and themes are untouched.

 * - "replace" mode: parent/genericBase + active_agent tag + env header +

 * - "append" mode: parent/genericBase + active_agent tag + env header +
 *   config.systemPrompt (wrapped in `<agent_instructions>` when non-empty).
 * - "append" with empty systemPrompt: pure parent clone.
 *
 * The two modes now differ only in the `<agent_instructions>` wrapper. The
 * `<sub_agent_context>` bridge append mode used to carry was removed in #890:
 * its tool bullets duplicated the `promptGuidelines` Pi's own tools contribute
 * to every child's prompt, and it asserted them unconditionally — telling a
 * read-only child to use `edit` and `write` when it has neither.
 *
 * Both modes include an `<active_agent name="${config.name}"/>` tag so
 * downstream extensions (e.g. `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`) can resolve
 * per-agent policy inside the child session by parsing the system prompt.
 * The tag follows the cacheable parent prefix in both modes.
 *
 * Only the parent prompt's identity is inherited — see `inheritedIdentity`.
 *
 * @param inherited  The parent agent's effective system prompt and the cwd it names.
 * @param loadProjectContext  Resolves a directory's project instructions, for a
 *   child whose adopted identity carries none describing its own.

 *

 * tool surface as `<tools>` and `<rules>` sections just below the preamble.
 * They are as session-resolved as the catalogue, so they are excised rather
 * than inherited (ADR 0011); the shared prefix then ends at the preamble for a
 * parent that renders them, and is unchanged for one that does not.
 *
 * A prompt carrying neither layer is not one `buildSystemPrompt` assembled, and

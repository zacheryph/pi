/**
 * notify-parent-tool.ts — The tool a child sends its delegating agent a one-way
 * update with.
 *
 * A running child that discovers something material — a course change, a wrong
 * premise, a scope problem — says so without abandoning its run. The call
 * returns at once; the parent may reply by steering, which the child picks up
 * at its next turn boundary.
 *
 * Supplied to every child, gated only on the `midRunUpdates` setting. Where
 * the message lands is decided per call rather than per child: while a carrier
 * holds this run's outcome it is blocked awaiting the child, so that carrier
 * renders the update into its own return instead of an announcement arriving
 * after it. A child whose parent is free is nudged as it goes.
 *
 * Lives in `session/` alongside `ask-parent-tool.ts`, for the same reason.

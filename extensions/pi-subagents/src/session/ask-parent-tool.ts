/**
 * ask-parent-tool.ts — The tool a child asks its delegating agent a question with.
 *
 * A child that cannot finish without information only its parent has records
 * the question here and ends its turn. The parent answers by resuming the
 * child, which continues with its context intact.
 *
 * The tool records; it does not announce. Every result carrier already renders
 * a pending question — with the exact resume call while the record is still
 * resumable, and why it is not once `Subagent.resumeRefusal` says otherwise —
 * so announcing here would tell the parent the same thing twice.
 *
 * Lives in `session/` rather than `tools/` because it is installed on the
 * child's session by the assembly factory, where every `tools/` module is
 * registered on the parent's.

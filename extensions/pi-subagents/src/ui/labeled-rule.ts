/**
 * labeled-rule.ts — a full-width horizontal rule with labels embedded in it, in
 * the style of Pi's editor border (`── ⠋ Working ─────`).
 *
 * `── <left> ─────── <right> ──`: the left label follows a two-dash lead-in, the
 * optional right label precedes a two-dash trailer, and dashes fill the gap.
 * Labels arrive already styled; `paint` colours only the rule's own characters,
 * so a caller can tint the rule without re-colouring the text it carries.
 *
 * Each label is a list of fallbacks in preference order. The right label is
 * dropped before the left one falls back, and when no left candidate fits, the
 * last is truncated with an ellipsis. The result always spans exactly `width`
 * columns: pi-tui rejects a wider row, and a narrower one leaves the rule short.

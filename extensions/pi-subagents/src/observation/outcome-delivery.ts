/**
 * outcome-delivery.ts — Shared rendering for a subagent outcome.
 *
 * A terminated child's outcome reaches the parent model through exactly one
 * carrier: the foreground tool return, the resume tool return, the
 * `get_subagent_result` report, or the completion nudge. Each carrier owns its
 * own framing (spawn notes, XML envelope, report header) and its own
 * truncation — a nudge is a preview, a pull is the full text — but the body
 * they wrap is the same fact, so it is rendered here rather than four times.
 *
 * A workspace notice rides the same four carriers without being part of the
 * outcome: it reports where a teardown put the child's work, which the parent
 * needs whether the run succeeded or failed. A notice produced after the
 * result was already delivered reaches none of them and is announced on its
 * own instead.
 *
 * The updates a child sent mid-run ride the carriers too, for the runs whose
 * outcome a blocked carrier holds: the announcement channel would deliver them
 * after that carrier's own return, so it renders them itself instead.
 *
 * The updates, the notice, and the ask-back affordance are appended in one
 * fixed order by `renderOutcomeAddenda`, so the three carriers that compose
 * them cannot disagree about what follows the body. The affordance is the one
 * addendum that asks the parent to call back, so it is also the one that has
 * to know whether that call would be accepted.
 *
 * Pure functions only: no SDK types, no record types, no side effects.

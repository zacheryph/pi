 *
 * A narrow structural slice of Pi's `BuildSystemPromptOptions` holding the
 * layers an operator wrote that describe no single session. `skills` is
 * excluded for the reason ADR 0006 cuts the catalogue: the child loads its
 * own. `contextFiles` is excluded for the same reason — the block names each
 * file by absolute path, so the child resolves it against its own directory
 * (#918). `promptGuidelines` is excluded because Pi derives it per session from
 * the tools actually in the registry, so inheriting the parent's would assert
 * guidance for tools the child may not hold — the defect ADR 0008 removed with
 * the `<sub_agent_context>` block. `selectedTools` and `toolSnippets` are
 * excluded because the tool surface is node-local prose.

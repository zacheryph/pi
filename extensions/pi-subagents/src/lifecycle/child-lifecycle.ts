/**
 * child-lifecycle.ts — Child-execution lifecycle event contract and publisher.
 *
 * The core publishes its child-execution lifecycle as ordered events on the Pi
 * event bus; reactive consumers (permissions, telemetry, UI) subscribe rather
 * than the core reaching out to them (ADR 0002). This module owns the channel
 * names, payload shapes, and the publisher that emits them.
 *
 * The publisher takes an injected `emit` callback so this module stays free of
 * Pi SDK imports — `index.ts` wires it to `pi.events.emit`.
 *
 * `spawning`, `session-created`, `completed`, and `disposed` are the announcement
 * a consumer may rely on. `bound` is additional: it reports that a child finished
 * binding its extensions, which is the only moment a parent can observe what those
 * extensions did or did not install.

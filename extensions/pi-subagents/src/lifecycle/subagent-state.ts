/**
 * subagent-state.ts — SubagentState value object: lifecycle status, metrics, and live activity.
 *
 * Owns the passive, readable state of a subagent — status, result, error,
 * timestamps, stats (toolUses, lifetimeUsage, compactionCount), and live-activity
 * fields (activeTools, responseText) and the live turn budget — together with the transition
 * methods (markRunning, markCompleted, …), accumulation methods
 * (incrementToolUses, addUsage, incrementCompactions), and live-activity
 * transition methods (setTurnBudget, addActiveTool, removeActiveTool,
 * resetResponseText, appendResponseText) that mutate them.
 *
 * State is encapsulated behind getters; external code reads through them but
 * mutates only via the transition/accumulation methods. The value object owns
 * all of its own mutations — no field is written from outside.
 *
 * Subagent holds one of these privately and delegates its getters and mutation
 * methods to it. Extracting it lets the lifecycle state machine and the
 * session-event observer be unit-tested without constructing an executor.

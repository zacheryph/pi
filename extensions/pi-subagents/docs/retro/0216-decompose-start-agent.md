# Retro: #216 — Decompose startAgent in agent-manager.ts

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-25T20:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Analyzed the `startAgent` method's structural problems beyond surface-level length.
The original issue proposed extracting three methods (`handleRunCompletion`, `handleRunError`, `finalizeBackgroundRun`).
Through design discussion, identified the root cause as **mutable closure state without an owner** — two `let` variables shared across three closures — and proposed a `RunHandle` lifecycle object as the missing collaborator.

### Observations

- The initial mechanical-extraction approach (3 methods) wouldn't have eliminated the mutable closure variables — `.then()`/`.catch()` would still close over `unsubRecordObserver` and `detach`.
  `RunHandle` eliminates these entirely by owning the resource-release handles.
- `WorktreeState` has an ask-tell smell: callers call `worktrees.cleanup()` then `worktreeState.recordCleanup()`.
  Adding `performCleanup()` is a small prep step that simplifies `RunHandle`'s completion/error methods.
- `record.description` is already available on `AgentRecord`, so `RunHandle` doesn't need `description` as a separate dependency — it can use `record.description` for worktree cleanup.
- `RunResult` is already exported from `agent-runner.ts`, so `RunHandle.complete()` can accept it directly without a new type.
- The `.catch()` handler doesn't wrap `onAgentCompleted` in try/catch while `.then()` does — `finalizeBackgroundRun` unifies this by always wrapping, preventing an observer error from blocking `drainQueue()`.
- `fireOnFinished` idempotency is important: if `complete()` throws after worktree cleanup but before returning, `.catch()` → `fail()` must not double-fire the background finalization.
  `AgentRecord`'s transition guards (`if (this._status !== "stopped")`) provide a second safety net.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-25T23:20:00Z)

### Session summary

Completed all 4 TDD steps across 5 commits (one extra for the type-annotation fixup caught by `pnpm run check`).
Added 4 new tests for `WorktreeState.performCleanup`; total test count rose from 958 to 962.
All 60 test files pass; `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm fallow dead-code` all clean.

### Observations

- One deviation from the plan: the `makeWorktrees` test helper in `worktree-state.test.ts` needed an explicit `WorktreeCleanupResult` type annotation on its `result` parameter — TypeScript inferred `{ hasChanges: boolean }` (no optional `branch`/`path` fields) from the default argument, which caused a type error on the call site that passed `{ hasChanges: true, branch: "pi-agent-1" }`.
  Fixed in the same commit as the `RunHandle` step.
- `RunHandle` landed exactly as designed: `wireSignal`, `attachObserver`, `complete`, `fail`, `releaseListeners`, `fireOnFinished` (idempotent). `startAgent` is now ~40 lines with zero mutable `let` bindings and one-liner `.then()`/`.catch()` handlers.
- `flushPendingSteers` and `setupWorktree` extracted cleanly — each about 8 lines, no surprises.
- The `WorktreeCleanupResult` import needed to be added to the test file alongside the existing `WorktreeManager` import for the type annotation fix — minor but worth noting for the next engineer.
- Architecture doc updated: Step 3 entry now reflects `RunHandle` rather than the original `handleRunCompletion`/`handleRunError` proposal.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-05-26T15:10:00Z)

### Session summary

Issue #216 was planned, implemented via 4 TDD steps (5 commits), shipped, CI verified (after a GitHub Actions outage), and released as `pi-subagents-v7.6.0`.
The final design replaced the original mechanical-extraction proposal with a `RunHandle` lifecycle object that eliminated mutable closure state from `startAgent`.

### Observations

#### What went well

- The user's two design redirections during planning ("What collaborators are still missing?"
  and "Make the change that makes the change easy") transformed a mechanical extraction plan into a structural improvement.
  The resulting `RunHandle` eliminated the root cause (mutable closure state) rather than just shortening the method.
- The prep-step pattern worked exactly as intended: `WorktreeState.performCleanup` (step 1) and `finalizeBackgroundRun` (step 3) made the `RunHandle` rewrite (step 4) straightforward.
  Step 4's large edit landed cleanly with all 962 tests passing on the first run.
- Two Explore subagents dispatched during planning (reading collaborator files and checking `WorktreeState` details) gathered the right context efficiently — `RunResult` being already exported and `record.description` being available at cleanup time were both discovered this way and shaped the `RunHandle` interface.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `premature-convergence` — accepted the issue's proposed mechanical extraction (3 methods) at face value and spent analysis time on LOC arithmetic before the user redirected toward structural thinking.
  Impact: two user redirections needed; no rework since no code was committed yet.
- `instruction-violation` (self-identified) — the testing skill says "run `pnpm run check` immediately after" changing a shared interface, but step 1 added `performCleanup` to `WorktreeState` without running `pnpm run check`.
  The type error in the test helper (`makeWorktrees` default parameter needing `WorktreeCleanupResult` annotation) went undetected for 3 commits until step 4's `pnpm run check`.
  Impact: added friction but no rework — fixed in the same commit.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- The user's design redirections were necessary and well-timed.
  No friction from the user side — the two interventions were strategic and saved significant implementation effort.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation** — two Explore subagents ran on `claude-haiku-4-5`; appropriate for read-only codebase search (reading collaborator files, checking types and test patterns).
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis** — `pnpm run check` ran only after step 4 (the `RunHandle` commit); should have run after step 1 (`WorktreeState.performCleanup` is a shared interface change per the testing skill).
  The gap allowed a type annotation error to persist for 3 commits.

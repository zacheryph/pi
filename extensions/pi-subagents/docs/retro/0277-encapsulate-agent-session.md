# Retro: #277 — Encapsulate AgentSession behind SubagentSession

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-30T12:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Produced an 8-step TDD plan covering delegate methods on `SubagentSession`, intent-revealing methods on `Agent`, caller migration across tools/service/UI/observation, observer callback narrowing, and `Agent.session` getter removal.
The plan extends the issue's three proposed methods with `getContextPercent()`, `subscribeToUpdates()`, and `messages` to fully satisfy the acceptance criterion that no production module outside `lifecycle/` references the raw `AgentSession`.

### Observations

- `subscribeAgentObserver` already accepts `SubscribableSession` (not `AgentSession`), so adding `subscribe()` to `SubagentSession` enables passing it directly — no `session` getter needed for observer wiring.
- The `onSessionCreated` observer callback delivers raw `AgentSession` to spawners in `tools/`.
  The plan narrows it to `(agent: Agent)` and has spawners use `agent.subagentSession!` which structurally satisfies both `SubscribableSession` and `SessionLike` via the new delegate methods.
- The conversation viewer uses `session.messages` for rendering and `session.subscribe()` for live updates — both require delegate methods beyond the issue's three proposed methods.
- `queueSteer()` and `flushPendingSteers()` become private after migration, which requires migrating existing tests that call them directly.
- The public API surface (`SubagentsService` + `SubagentRecord`) is unaffected — `Agent` is internal.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-30T15:10:00Z)

### Session summary

All 8 TDD steps completed in one session. 13 commits landed: 2 `feat:`, 5 `refactor:`, 2 `docs:`, 1 `style:`, plus the earlier plan and retro commits.
Test count went from 960 → 973 (+13 net: +18 new tests, −5 removed tests for the retired `session` getter and `queueSteer`/`flushPendingSteers` private methods).

### Observations

- `subscribeAgentObserver` already accepted `SubscribableSession`, so `SubagentSession` (once it grew a `subscribe()` delegate) could be passed directly in `Agent.run()` and `Agent.resume()` — no cast needed.
- Adding `messages` to `MockSession` interface was a minor unplanned step: the field existed at runtime (via `createMockSession`'s spread) but the interface didn't declare it, causing a type error when `createSubagentSessionStub` tried to forward it.
- `onSessionCreated` tests in `foreground-runner.test.ts` called the callback with 2 args `(record, mockSess)`.
  After narrowing, the first test case was missing a `subagentSession` setup; fixed by setting `record.subagentSession` before invoking the callback.
- The `get-result-tool.test.ts` verbose conversation test needed updating: previously built a mock session with messages and passed it directly; now the stub's `getConversation` must return the expected text via `mockReturnValue`.
- Pre-completion reviewer returned **WARN** for two stale `architecture.md` passages: (1) conversation-viewer description still said "subscribes directly to `AgentSession`"; (2) `Agent` classDiagram still listed `queueSteer`/`flushPendingSteers` as public and omitted the 6 new public members.
  Both fixed in a `docs:` commit before closing.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-05-30T16:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Issue #277 shipped across three sessions (planning, TDD, ship) in a single day.
All 8 TDD steps completed cleanly, 13 implementation commits landed, and `pi-subagents-v13.2.0` released.

### Observations

#### What went well

- Planning correctly identified scope beyond the issue's three proposed methods: `getContextPercent()`, `subscribeToUpdates()`, and `messages` were needed to satisfy the "no production module outside `lifecycle/` references `AgentSession`" acceptance criterion.
  This prevented mid-TDD design revisions.
- The discovery that `subscribeAgentObserver` already accepted `SubscribableSession` meant adding `subscribe()` to `SubagentSession` was sufficient for observer wiring — no type cast or adapter needed.
- Lift-and-shift execution was precise: new methods added first (steps 1-2), callers migrated by concern (steps 3-6), old getter removed last (step 7).
  No step broke any other step's tests.
- Pre-completion reviewer caught two stale `architecture.md` passages (classDiagram with removed public methods, conversation-viewer description) that the implementation steps missed.
  Both fixed in a `docs:` commit before closing.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

1. `missing-context` — `MockSession` interface lacked `messages`.
   The field existed at runtime (via `createMockSession`'s spread + `Record<string, unknown>` return type) but the `MockSession` interface didn't declare it.
   Adding `messages` to `createSubagentSessionStub` triggered a type error.
   Impact: 2 extra edits to `mock-session.ts` (add field to interface, add to `base` object), no rework.
2. `missing-context` — `get-result-tool.test.ts` conversation test relied on raw mock session messages.
   After migrating to `record.getConversation()`, the stub's `getConversation` returned `""` by default.
   The test needed `stub.getConversation.mockReturnValue("...")` instead.
   Impact: 1 test update, caught immediately by `pnpm vitest run`.
3. `missing-context` — `foreground-runner.test.ts` called `onSessionCreated(record, mockSess)` with 2 args.
   After narrowing the callback to `(agent: Agent)`, the first test lacked `record.subagentSession` setup.
   Impact: 2 test blocks updated, caught by `pnpm vitest run`.
4. `missing-context` — First `get-result-tool.ts` edit left a double-nested `if (conversation)` block.
   The multi-edit replaced the outer `if (params.verbose && record.session)` but preserved the inner guard, creating `if (conversation) { if (conversation) { ... } }`.
   Impact: Self-caught on immediate read-back; fixed in the same commit, no rework.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- None observed.
  The user's involvement was limited to the `/plan-issue`, `/tdd-plan`, `/ship-issue`, and `/retro` prompts — no mid-session corrections or redirections were needed.

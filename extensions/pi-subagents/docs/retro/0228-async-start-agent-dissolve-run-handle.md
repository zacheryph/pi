# Retro: #228 — Convert startAgent to async/await, move run lifecycle to Agent

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-27T20:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned the async `startAgent` conversion and decided to dissolve `RunHandle` into Agent methods rather than moving it as a separate class.
Identified three preparatory steps (narrow promise type, add Agent methods, hoist worktree setup) that make the final async conversion a minimal diff.

### Observations

- The original issue proposed `Agent.createRunHandle()` as a factory, keeping RunHandle as a separate class.
  Analysis showed 5 of 6 RunHandle concerns are Agent state mutations — RunHandle is doing work that belongs on Agent.
  The clincher was `resume()` in `agent-manager.ts`: it duplicates RunHandle's pattern manually, and #232 wants to unify them.
  Dissolving RunHandle gives both `startAgent` and `resume` the same primitives (`completeRun`, `failRun`, `releaseListeners`).
- The synchronous-throw contract in `spawn()` for worktree failures requires hoisting `record.setupWorktree()` out of `startAgent` before the async conversion.
  Without this prep step, async `startAgent` would turn the throw into a rejected promise that `spawn()` doesn't catch.
- `promise: Promise<string>` → `Promise<void>` is safe because the resolved string is dead — every consumer reads `record.result` instead.
  Only one test assertion reads the resolved value.
- `completeRun`/`failRun` take `worktrees: WorktreeManager` as a parameter rather than storing it on Agent (ISP — only needed at run end, exactly two callers).

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-27T20:40:00Z)

### Session summary

Implemented all 6 TDD steps: narrowed `promise` to `Promise<void>`, added 6 run lifecycle methods to Agent (+19 tests), replaced `RunHandle` with Agent methods (-85 LOC), hoisted worktree setup to callers, converted `startAgent` to async/await, and updated architecture docs.
Test count: 986 → 1005.

### Observations

- Step 1 (promise narrowing) required fixing 3 additional test files not listed in the plan: `make-agent.test.ts`, `service-adapter.test.ts`, `get-result-tool.test.ts`.
  All were trivial `Promise.resolve("done")` → `Promise.resolve()` changes and a cast removal.
- The lift-and-shift approach worked cleanly — each of the 5 implementation commits was small and independently green.
  The most impactful commit was step 3 (replace RunHandle, -96/+6 lines) which was risk-free because step 2 had already introduced the Agent methods.
- Pre-completion reviewer returned WARN for stale `AgentRecord` and `run-handle.ts` references in `architecture.md` class diagram and layout listing.
  These were pre-existing staleness from #227's rename that wasn't fully propagated to Mermaid diagrams.
  Fixed by amending the docs commit.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-05-27T21:46:00Z)

### Session summary

Completed all stages (plan, TDD, ship, retro) in a single session.
Dissolved `RunHandle` into 6 Agent methods, converted `startAgent` to async/await, released as `pi-subagents-v10.2.0`.
Test delta: 986 → 1005 (+19).

### Observations

#### What went well

- The user's two redirecting questions during planning ("What's the change that makes this easier?"
  and "Tell me more about RunHandle — is there something that should replace it?") transformed a mechanical "move the class" plan into a "dissolve the abstraction" plan.
  The dissolve approach is architecturally superior and sets up #232 (resume unification) for free.
- The lift-and-shift decomposition (introduce Agent methods alongside `RunHandle`, then swap and delete) produced 5 independently-green commits.
  The riskiest commit (step 3: delete `RunHandle`, -96/+6 lines) was trivially safe because step 2 had already proven the replacement methods.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `premature-convergence` — The agent planned around the issue's proposed `Agent.createRunHandle()` factory without questioning whether `RunHandle` should exist as a separate class.
  The user had to ask two redirecting questions to push the analysis deeper.
  Impact: plan was rewritten before commit (no wasted implementation), but the user spent two turns guiding analysis the agent should have done proactively.
- `missing-context` — Plan step 1 (narrow `Promise<string>` to `Promise<void>`) listed only `agent-manager.test.ts` for updates but missed 3 additional test files (`make-agent.test.ts`, `service-adapter.test.ts`, `get-result-tool.test.ts`) that construct `Promise<string>` values.
  The testing skill says "grep for all test files" for type changes — this was not applied during planning.
  Impact: caught by `pnpm run check` in the same step, no rework.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- No friction observed.
  The user's questioning style (asking "what does it do?
  who needs it?"
  rather than prescribing the solution) was collaborative and effective.

### Changes made

1. `.pi/prompts/plan-issue.md` — added relocation-dissolution heuristic: when an issue proposes moving a class, list callers and fields touched to check if it should be dissolved into the owner instead.

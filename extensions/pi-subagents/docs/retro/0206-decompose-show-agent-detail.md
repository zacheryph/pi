# Retro: #206 — Decompose showAgentDetail (cognitive 33)

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-25T12:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Produced a 4-step plan to decompose `showAgentDetail` (cognitive 33) and `ejectAgent` (cognitive 20) in `ui/agent-config-editor.ts`.
The plan extracts two exported pure functions (`buildMenuOptions`, `buildEjectContent`) with dedicated unit tests, plus three closure-internal handlers (`handleEdit`, `handleDelete`, `handleReset`).

### Observations

- Three of the six action handlers (`ejectAgent`, `disableAgent`, `enableAgent`) were already extracted as closure functions — only Edit, Delete, and Reset were inlined in the dispatch chain.
- `buildMenuOptions` and `buildEjectContent` are ideal pure-function extractions: complex branching logic with no IO dependencies, previously untestable in isolation.
- The existing 18 integration tests through `showAgentDetail` provide a strong safety net — no risk of behavior regression during extraction.
- Chose to scope `ejectAgent` decomposition into this issue since the issue's outcome says "< 10 per function" and `ejectAgent` is at cognitive 20 in the same file.
- `disableAgent` and `enableAgent` were explicitly deferred — their cognitive complexity is manageable and decomposing them would add scope without meaningful benefit.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-25T11:55:00Z)

### Session summary

Completed all 4 TDD steps. 3 `refactor:` commits extract `buildMenuOptions`, the three inline handlers, and `buildEjectContent`; 1 `docs:` commit updates the architecture table.
Test count grew from 21 to 33 (+12 new unit tests for the two exported pure functions).

### Observations

- A `newText: null` bug in the Edit tool corrupted `agent-config-editor.ts` during step 1; recovered immediately by rewriting the file with `Write`.
- The test used `thinking: "auto"` which is not a valid `ThinkingLevel` — fixed by changing to `"low"` before the final commit; the type error was caught by `pnpm run check` after the TDD step.
- `buildMenuOptions` extracted cleanly with early-return style (no `let menuOptions` intermediate); the refactored function passes all 5 new unit tests and all 21 existing integration tests.
- `handleEdit`, `handleDelete`, and `handleReset` are closure-internal; they drop the outer `if (file)` guard since the menu only shows those options when `file` is defined.
- `buildEjectContent` extracted from `ejectAgent` reduces `ejectAgent` to a thin IO function (~10 lines); no behavior change verified by the existing eject integration tests.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-05-25T12:10:00Z)

### Session summary

Completed full lifecycle — Planning, TDD (3 `refactor:` + 1 `docs:` commits, +12 tests), Ship, and Release (`pi-subagents-v7.2.7`) — in a single session with no user corrections.

### Observations

#### What went well

- The three-stage workflow (plan → TDD → ship) executed without any user intervention between stages.
  Each stage's retro notes provided clean context for the next.
- Pure-function extraction pattern worked cleanly: `buildMenuOptions` and `buildEjectContent` exported for unit testing; `handleEdit`, `handleDelete`, `handleReset` kept as closure-internal, tested via existing integration tests.
- The existing 21 integration tests caught no regressions across all 3 refactor commits — strong safety net for mechanical extraction.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `other` — Passed `newText: null` to the `Edit` tool during TDD step 1, injecting a literal `null` into `agent-config-editor.ts` and corrupting the file.
  Self-identified immediately via Biome autoformat failure.
  Impact: one wasted tool round-trip; recovered by rewriting the file with `Write`.
- `missing-context` — Used `thinking: "auto"` in a `buildEjectContent` test fixture without checking `ThinkingLevel` is `"minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh"`.
  Self-identified by `pnpm run check` post-TDD gate.
  Impact: one `--amend` fix, no extra commit.
- `missing-context` — Plan stated "18 tests" as the baseline count; actual baseline was 21.
  Impact: none — just an inaccurate number in the plan text.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- No user-side friction observed.
  The user triggered each stage sequentially without needing to redirect or correct.

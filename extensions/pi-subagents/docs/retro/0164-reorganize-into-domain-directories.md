# Retro: #164 — refactor(pi-subagents): reorganize source into domain directories

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-23T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Read issue #164, confirmed #157 (import normalization) was a prerequisite and had been completed.
Explored the full `src/` and `test/` structure, mapped every relative import in the 26 files to be moved, and produced a four-commit plan that moves files domain-by-domain in dependency order.

### Observations

- Issue #157 removed `.js` suffixes and introduced `#src/*` aliases in `test/` files.
  This makes the reorganization cleaner: test imports are flat `#src/agent-manager` → `#src/lifecycle/agent-manager` with no depth variation.
- `lifecycle/` and `observation/` have a circular dependency (`agent-manager` ↔ `record-observer`), so they must be moved in a single commit (Step 3).
  All other domains can be committed independently.
- `vitest.config.ts` uses `"test/**/*.test.ts"` — test files in new subdirectories are
  auto-discovered without config changes.
- Three UI test files (`conversation-viewer.test.ts`, `display.test.ts`,
  `widget-renderer.test.ts`) are misplaced at `test/` root; left out of scope for this issue.
- No `default-agents.test.ts`, `context.test.ts`, or `execution-state.test.ts` exist —
  those src modules have no dedicated test files.
- The import tables in the plan enumerate every path change; `pnpm run check` will catch
  any missed update before each commit.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-23T16:55:00Z)

### Session summary

Executed all four plan steps (config, session, lifecycle+observation, service) plus a fifth unplanned step converting all `src/` internal imports to `#src/` aliases.
All 50 test files and 805 tests pass throughout.
Updated `docs/architecture/architecture.md` to reflect the completed restructuring.

### Observations

- The plan's consumer tables were mostly complete but missed a few files: `src/ui/widget-renderer.ts` and `src/session-config.ts` (still at root during step 1) both imported `agent-types`; `src/service-adapter.ts` imported `model-resolver`; `test/parent-snapshot.test.ts` had a `vi.mock("#src/context")` path.
  All caught immediately by `pnpm run check` or a failing test.
- `src/service-adapter.ts` and `src/service.ts` (still at root during step 3) imported `parent-snapshot` and `usage` which moved in that step, so they had to be fixed as part of step 3's commit rather than step 4's.
- The `#src/` alias conversion (fifth commit) was added after the user correctly observed that `src/` files should use the same alias style as `test/` files.
  This eliminates all `../` relative cross-directory imports from `src/`.
  Future file moves in `src/` now only require updating the `#src/domain/name` string — no relative depth arithmetic.
- Biome auto-fixed 14 files (import sorting / trailing whitespace) during the `#src/` conversion step; committed via `git add -A` after the pre-commit hook run.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-05-23T17:10:00Z)

### Session summary

Shipped #164 (6 commits, `pi-subagents-v6.17.2`), filed #174 (ESLint for type-aware rules + import path enforcement), and reviewed the full issue lifecycle across planning, implementation, and shipping sessions.

### Observations

#### What went well

- The user's mid-implementation redirect to use `#src/` aliases in `src/` files was the highest-impact intervention across the entire issue.
  It eliminated the `../` depth-arithmetic problem, simplified the final commit to a one-liner `sed` command across 40 files, and directly motivated #174.
- `pnpm run check` (`tsc --noEmit`) caught every missed consumer immediately — no broken commit ever landed.
- The four-step dependency ordering (config → session → lifecycle+observation → service) kept every commit green despite the circular dependency between `lifecycle` and `observation`.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `wrong-abstraction` — Used ~60 individual `Edit` tool calls across steps 1–4 for what was a mechanical find-and-replace.
  The fifth commit proved `sed` handles bulk import rewrites across 40 files in a single command.
  Impact: hundreds of unnecessary tool calls and significant token waste across four commits.
- `missing-context` — The plan's consumer tables missed 4 files (`src/ui/widget-renderer.ts`, `src/session-config.ts`, `src/service-adapter.ts`, `test/parent-snapshot.test.ts` `vi.mock` path).
  The plan manually traced imports instead of using `grep` to enumerate all consumers of each moving module.
  Impact: mid-step rework in steps 1, 2, and 3 to fix un-updated imports caught by `tsc`.
- `missing-context` — Did not recognize that `src/` files should use `#src/` aliases (same as `test/` files) even though #157 set up the aliases for exactly this purpose.
  Impact: all four domain-move commits used relative `../` imports, requiring a fifth unplanned commit to convert them.
  User-caught.
- `wrong-abstraction` — The agent lacks access to LSP-level refactoring tools ("Move to file", "Rename symbol") that a human developer would use for this kind of reorganization.
  A human with an LSP would have completed the entire issue in minutes with zero missed consumers.
  This is a fundamental capability gap — the agent compensated with low-level text manipulation, which is error-prone and token-expensive.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- The `#src/` alias convention was established in #157 but the user didn't flag it during the planning session.
  Had this been raised during planning, all four domain-move commits would have used `#src/` from the start.
  The user did catch it during implementation, which was still early enough to save the final result.

# Retro: #462 — pi-subagents: upgrade /subagent-sessions renderer to Pi per-entry TUI components

## Stage: Planning (2026-06-22T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned Phase 19 Step 4a: swap the `/subagent-sessions` renderer from `serializeConversation` plain text to Pi's per-entry TUI components behind the existing `TranscriptSource` seam.
Verified the SDK surface (per-entry components, `parseSkillBlock`, `getMarkdownTheme`, `ToolDefinition`, `AgentSession.getToolDefinition`) and mirrored Pi's own `renderSessionContext`/`rebuildChatFromMessages` mapping.
Wrote a four-step TDD plan at `packages/pi-subagents/docs/plans/0462-navigation-renderer-tui-components.md` and committed it.

### Observations

- Three design decisions were surfaced via `ask_user` and locked by the operator:
  1. **Rebuild-on-change** (mirror Pi's `rebuildChatFromMessages`) over incremental `updateContent`/`updateResult` — the seam exposes only a full `getMessages()` snapshot plus a coarse `onChange`, so incremental would still diff snapshots while replicating Pi's `pendingTools` streaming state machine for marginal benefit.
  2. **Keep the lightweight `◍ describeActivity` text indicator** — this absorbs the high-frequency streaming text, so the persisted component tree only changes at message granularity, which is what keeps rebuild-on-change cheap.
  3. **Wire real tool definitions** — the operator flagged a dependency-inversion risk ("can't `SubagentManager` track this?").
     Resolved dependency-safely: the SDK `AgentSession` already exposes `getToolDefinition(name)`, so a new read accessor on `SubagentSession`/`Subagent` (mirroring the existing `agentMessages` accessor) surfaces it through the record and onto the `TranscriptSource` seam — arrows stay inward, no `SubagentManager` bookkeeping.
- Key structural move: the component renderer must leave the pure `session-navigation.ts` (per-entry components need `TUI`/`cwd`/`markdownTheme`) and live in the SDK/TUI `session-navigator.ts`.
  The pure module sheds `renderTranscriptLines`/`serializeConversation` entirely, becoming selection + sourcing only.
- The `renderTranscriptLines` removal, overlay rewrite, `session-navigation.ts` edits, `index.ts` `cwd` wiring, and test updates must land in **one commit** (TDD step 3) — removing the export breaks the overlay and its tests at the type level.
- Non-breaking internal renderer swap; `Release: independent` per the roadmap.
  Step 4a gates Step 5 ([#442]) for rendering parity but is not part of any release batch.
- Follow-up [#463] (Step 4b, file-snapshot source) already exists and is open — referenced as a Non-Goal, nothing new to file.
- Parity is defined as *using Pi's own components*, not byte-equality with the bespoke viewer; `custom`-role messages are skipped (the bespoke viewer never rendered them either), noted as an Open Question.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-06-22T21:30:00Z)

### Session summary

Executed all four planned TDD steps: the `getToolDefinition` read accessor on `SubagentSession`/`Subagent`, the seam method on `TranscriptSource`/`NavigableSubagent`, the per-entry component renderer + overlay rewrite + `cwd` wiring, and the architecture doc flip (Step 4a `✅`).
The renderer now mounts Pi's interactive components into a cached `Container` rebuilt on source change, mirroring Pi's `renderSessionContext`.
Test count went from 1084 to 1088 (+4 net: +4 accessor/seam tests, +3 new navigator tests, −3 removed `renderTranscriptLines` tests), all green; one post-review `test:` commit pins invariant #423.

### Observations

- The production code (`session-navigation.ts`, `session-navigator.ts`, `index.ts`) type-checked clean on the first `tsc` run — the SDK message-union narrowing (`switch (message.role)`), component construction, and `updateResult(toolResultMessage)` all resolved without casts.
  `SessionMessage` (= the SDK `AgentMessage` union) narrows by `role` even though `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` is not a direct dependency.
- Two deviations from the plan's Module-Level Changes, both intentional: (1) `src/types.ts` was *not* changed — `ToolDefinition` is imported directly from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` in each consumer rather than re-exported through the barrel (avoids a speculative re-export `fallow` would flag); (2) `test/helpers/mock-session.ts` gained a `getToolDefinition` stub (needed for the step-1 accessor tests, not listed in the plan).
- Pi's per-entry components read a *global* interactive theme initialized by `initTheme()`; Pi does this at startup, but tests had to call `initTheme(undefined, false)` in `beforeAll`.
  An early probe with `AssistantMessageComponent` passed without it, but `UserMessageComponent`/`ToolExecutionComponent` throw `"Theme not initialized"` — so the global-theme dependency is component-specific and only surfaced once the broader role set was exercised.
- `setComplete`'s `TruncationResult` param requires more fields than `BashExecutionMessage` carries, so the bash component is completed with `undefined` truncation info (command + output still render).
  Pi's own JS passes `{ truncated: true }` but that path is untyped.
- Pre-completion reviewer verdict: **WARN** (no failures; 3 non-blocking findings).
  Reviewer warnings: (1) `package-pi-subagents/SKILL.md` UI module count is stale (10 listed vs 13 actual) — predates this issue, plan left it deliberately; (2) `addMessageComponents` mutates the received `pendingTools` accumulator (output-argument pattern) — intentional, mirrors Pi's own `renderedPendingTools` local and was plan-reviewed; (3) invariant #423 held and is type-enforced but lacked an explicit spy pin — **addressed** by the follow-up `test:` commit asserting the handler never calls `record.getToolDefinition` directly.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-06-23T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Shipped Phase 19 Step 4a end-to-end across plan → TDD → ship: `/subagent-sessions` now renders through Pi's own per-entry interactive components behind the unchanged `TranscriptSource` seam, released as `pi-subagents` v17.4.0.
Execution was notably clean — six commits, no rework of production code, CI green on the first push, and the only two friction points (a missing `initTheme()` in tests, a wrong post-review assertion) were each self-caught and resolved in a single iteration.

### Observations

#### What went well

1. **Upfront SDK verification in planning paid off at implementation.**
   Planning inspected the actual component constructors, the `renderSessionContext` mapping, and `AgentSession.getToolDefinition` in `node_modules/**/*.d.ts` before committing to a design.
   Result: the production code (`session-navigation.ts`, `session-navigator.ts`, `index.ts`) type-checked clean on the *first* `tsc` run during TDD — the SDK message-union narrowing and component construction needed no casts.
2. **Probe-driven de-risking.**
   Before the renderer rewrite, a throwaway `_probe-theme.test.ts` confirmed `getMarkdownTheme()` + a Pi component render works outside interactive mode — validating the riskiest assumption cheaply, then deleted.
3. **The operator's planning interjections were strategic, not mechanical.**
   Rather than picking an `ask_user` option, the operator asked "what update frequency are we anticipating?"
   and flagged a dependency-inversion risk on tool definitions.
   Both redirects improved the design: the frequency analysis justified rebuild-on-change, and the inversion concern led to the dependency-safe `getToolDefinition` read accessor (discovered on the SDK, not invented).
4. **Incremental verification throughout.**
   Targeted `vitest` per Red→Green step, `pnpm run check` immediately after each shared-interface change, then full suite + root lint + `fallow dead-code` before each commit — no end-of-session verification pile-up.
5. **Pre-completion review caught a real gap and the fix's own bug was caught by the loop.**
   The reviewer flagged the missing #423 spy pin; while adding it, an over-assertion (`getToolDefinition` called on a no-toolCall fixture) failed the test run and was removed before committing.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

1. `missing-context` (self-identified) — the `initTheme()` requirement for Pi's interactive components.
   The de-risking probe exercised only `AssistantMessageComponent`, which happens *not* to read the global theme, so the probe passed and gave false confidence.
   The real tests then threw `"Theme not initialized"` from `UserMessageComponent`/`ToolExecutionComponent`.
   Impact: one extra Red cycle (4 failing tests) → added `beforeAll(() => initTheme(undefined, false))`; no production rework.
2. `other` (self-identified) — a wrong second assertion in the post-review #423 pin (`expect(record.getToolDefinition).toHaveBeenCalled()` on a fixture whose assistant message had no `toolCall`, so the lookup never fires).
   Impact: one failed test run, immediately diagnosed and the bad assertion removed; ~1 iteration.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- None.
  The operator's interventions were timely and strategic (see What went well #3); no context was withheld and no correction was reactive.

### Diagnostic details

- **Feedback-loop gap analysis** — no gap.
  Verification ran incrementally: per-step targeted `vitest`, `pnpm run check` after each interface change, full suite + lint + `fallow` before commits.
  Both friction points were caught by running tests *before* committing, not after.
- **Escalation-delay tracking** — no rabbit holes; each friction point resolved in a single iteration (well under the 5-tool-call threshold).
- **Probe-coverage note** — the `initTheme()` miss is a probe *coverage* gap, not a tool-availability gap: a one-variant probe (`AssistantMessageComponent`) did not validate the environment dependency of the broader component set actually used.
- **Model-performance / unused-tool** — nothing notable.
  The only subagent dispatch (`pre-completion-reviewer`) is purpose-built for judgment-heavy review; SDK inspection used direct `grep`/`bash` over `.d.ts` files, which was appropriate.

### Changes made

1. `.pi/skills/package-pi-subagents/SKILL.md` — added a `## Testing` note: tests mounting Pi's per-entry interactive components must call `initTheme(undefined, false)` in `beforeAll`, with the component-specific / false-confidence caveat.
2. `.pi/skills/package-pi-subagents/SKILL.md` — corrected the stale UI domain module count (10 → 13) and extended its responsibility blurb to include session navigation.
3. `.pi/skills/testing/SKILL.md` — extended the existing "Exploration before planning" disposable-probe bullet to require exercising the full input variety (variant-specific environment dependencies defeat a one-representative probe).
   Placement confirmed with the operator: kept in the `testing` skill (loaded by both `/plan-issue` and `/tdd-plan`) next to the sibling rule, rather than duplicated into the plan prompt.

# Retro: #71 - extract session-config assembler

## Final Retrospective (2026-05-19T22:15:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned, implemented, and shipped `assembleSessionConfig()` - a pure configuration assembler extracted from `runAgent()` in `agent-runner.ts`.
Eight TDD steps completed across three phases (plan, implement, ship), adding 33 new tests in `test/session-config.test.ts` and reducing `runAgent()` from ~390 lines to ~198.
Released as `pi-subagents-v5.3.0`.
Filed follow-up #80 (consolidate `getConfig`/`getAgentConfig`) and updated the architecture roadmap.

### Observations

#### What went well

- The user's redirecting question ("Do we need more decomposition?
  Are there any seams we can exploit?") at the `as any` fix point was perfectly timed.
  It shifted the approach from mechanical casting (8 `as any` casts) to a structural fix: `unknown` for opaque model handles, `Array<{ provider: string; id: string }>` for the availability check.
  The final design removed the `@earendil-works/pi-ai` import from `session-config.ts` entirely - cleaner than the plan's original specification of `Model<any>`.
- The prior art from `pi-permission-system` (`evaluate()` extraction) provided a clear template for the pure-core-from-IO-shell pattern.
  Design decisions were minimal.
- All 451 existing tests stayed green through every intermediate commit.
  The mock-at-module-boundary strategy (`vi.mock("../src/agent-types.js")` etc.) meant existing `agent-runner.test.ts` mocks continued to intercept the same module paths even after the assembler delegated to them.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `premature-convergence` - When `pnpm run check` surfaced 10 type errors from `Model<any>` in `SessionConfig`, the first fix attempt was adding `as any` casts to the `vi.fn` factory return values and all test model objects (8 casts total).
  This partially addressed the symptom but created new `never[]` inference errors and left a fundamentally wrong interface.
  The user's first pushback ("Can we find a real type?") prompted a proper analysis of `Model<TApi>`'s ~10 required fields, leading to the `unknown` solution.
  Impact: ~20 minutes of rework across 3 attempts (the `as any` factory cast, diagnosing the residual `never[]` errors, and the final `unknown` rewrite). (user-caught)

- `missing-context` - The plan omitted `agentMaxTurns` from the `SessionConfig` return type.
  `runAgent()`'s turn-limit resolution reads `agentConfig?.maxTurns`, which is no longer available after the assembly delegation.
  Caught during step 7 (wiring) when the code wouldn't compile without it.
  Impact: added one field to `SessionConfig` and `assembleSessionConfig`; no rework of earlier steps, but the commit body noted the deviation. (self-identified at implementation time)

- `missing-context` - The `vi.fn(() => [])` → `never[]` TypeScript inference issue wasn't anticipated.
  Five mock factories (`mockGetMemoryToolNames`, `mockGetReadOnlyMemoryToolNames`, `mockPreloadSkills`, `mockRegistry.find`, `mockRegistry.getAvailable`) needed explicit return-type annotations.
  Impact: one debug cycle to diagnose, then a second to fix with `import type` annotations. (self-identified during `pnpm run check`)

#### What caused friction (user side)

- The user's second pushback ("Do we need more decomposition?") was the highest-leverage intervention in the session.
  Without it, the `as any` approach would have landed and the `pi-ai` import would have stayed in `session-config.ts` - defeating the goal of a SDK-free business-logic module.
  The pattern of catching design-level issues through "is there a better seam?"
  questions is worth preserving.

#### Design observations (not actionable as rules)

- The `cfg.model as Model<any> | undefined` cast in `agent-runner.ts` is a legitimate interim cost — it's one line at the SDK boundary and will be resolved when #66 (replace `as any` casts with proper SDK types) and #72 (AgentManager DI) refine the interface contracts.
  Codifying “use `unknown` + boundary cast” as a general pattern would normalize something that should feel uncomfortable and motivate further interface refinement.

### Changes made

1. `.pi/skills/testing/SKILL.md` — added `vi.fn()` return-type annotation rule under “Vitest mock patterns”: annotate factories that return empty arrays or narrow literals to prevent `never[]` inference.
